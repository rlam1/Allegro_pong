ALLEGRO_Pong
============

Because the world needs another Pong clone...

This one is made in Allegro 5.0.10

This is a game in progress!!!
-----------------------------

So don't expect anything playable yet... I mean, we are not even in alpha, not even prototype.
Im using this mainly as a personal project so that I finally teach myself how to do a proper game.


What I am doing right now?
---------------------------

*Well*...

  - [X] Finding good foundation libraries so I don't reinvent the wheel again.
  - [ ] Sketching Core game systems and interactions between libraries.
  - [ ] Investigating a little about AI and game implementations of it (very **VERY** tedious)
  - [X] Enyoing a good read of [game programming patterns](http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com).
  - [X] Testing colours and styles so THEN start doing some artwork.
  - [X] Having a life apart of this...
  * You get the idea
  
About the Windows project file...
---------------------------------

The Windows project file does not use best examples in where the library is located, so Allegro is in an arbitrary location in my diskm but if you take the project be sure to configure it correctly before trying to build everything.
